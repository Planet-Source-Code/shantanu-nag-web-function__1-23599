### Description

Web function (WF) is a simple technology, which allows any client to execute a function remotely on a web server and return the result back to the client over HTTP.

Few usage examples:

-By using Web function you will be able to execute a database call and return the result back over the port 80, thus by passing the firewall problems.

-Web Function allows exposing standard methods or services, which can be used by any client.

-Perform custom messaging services like pop up a small message box on the client machine once the reports have been updated on the server.

-What ever you can think of?
